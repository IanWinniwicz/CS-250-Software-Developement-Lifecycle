# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs usually comes from the interpretation of user feedback through user stories, how the end product interacts with the customer and vice versa makes you understand what changes need to be made. You implement them into the program through a cycle of building, testing, feedback, and more building.

#How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

The agile processes I hope to incorporate into my future developement work is planning before I start a project, this will help me work smoother and not get stuck having to think about what to do next, and testing. I know it is important to save frequently but now I realize the importance of frequent testing.


#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member means to listen to your team and work as a team member. Remember that you are not alone. Communication is very important. Always do your part of the work so you don't holld your team back.
